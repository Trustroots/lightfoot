# Contributing to Lightfoot

## 🚧 Early Development Status

**Lightfoot is currently in super early development.** This project is actively being built and many features are still being implemented. Expect frequent changes, breaking updates, and evolving architecture as we shape this postal delivery community platform.

## 🗺️ Development Approach

Lightfoot's development closely follows the pattern established by [Hitchmap-Nostr](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchmap-nostr) due to the similarity in:

- **Nostr protocol integration** for decentralized data
- **Map-based interface** for geographic features
- **Community-driven content** and user interactions
- **SvelteKit + TypeScript** technology stack
- **Real-time data processing** and display

Many architectural decisions, patterns, and approaches are adapted from the Hitchmap-Nostr project to leverage proven solutions for similar challenges.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Since we're in early development:

1. **Check existing issues** before starting work
2. **Open an issue first** to discuss significant changes
3. **Small, focused PRs** are preferred during this phase
4. **Documentation updates** are always welcome
5. **Bug reports** help us stabilize the platform

## 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
